This is an iPhone app that everyone can enjoy with its intuitive design. It starts with a user logging in with a Google account using Google auth. This streamlines the process and ensures better security. It is then driven by what we have coined as circles. This is your group of friends you are going to vote with. It will prompt you to create a circle or to join one with a code. If you are creating a circle, a code will be generated. This has a share feature to make it easily accessible to all your friends. It shows you as they join, and you can decide on the location you want to search for after everyone is in; it's time to swipe! Inspired by Tinder, all the restaurants in the area are shown with a star rating. You swipe right or heart the ones you like/ would want to go to and left/ press x for the ones you don't. At the end, it ranks them among all your friends so you can find you guys top pick and Munch!
